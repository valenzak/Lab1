      "1) Join the table to the shapefile, which adds county names to each census tract.  At first, I was going to write out about 50 elifs, but I asked Prof. Bergmann, who recommended a join would be more efficient (Duh).  I got halfway through writing my elifs, so this step, along with the initial setup of everything, took half an hour or so. Less than 5 minutes after Bergmann recommended joining."

Anyways, by looking for examples online, I noticed that all of them did this. This problem solving took maybe half an hour."
